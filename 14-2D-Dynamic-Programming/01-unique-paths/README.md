## Problem

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m-1][n-1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= m, n <= 100

## Local practice

Edit `solution.cpp`, then run:

```sh
./test
```

Tests live in `tests/cases.cpp`. Reference answers in `misc/reference.hpp` contain spoilers.
These are independent local tests, not the platform’s private judge suite.
