## Problem

Given an array of integers temperatures representing daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

## Local practice

Edit `solution.cpp`, then run:

```sh
./test
```

Tests live in `tests/cases.cpp`. Reference answers in `misc/reference.hpp` contain spoilers.
These are independent local tests, not the platform’s private judge suite.
